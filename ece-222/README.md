# Sample Problems to Practice:

In general, we'll probably get a lot of questions on the theory...

## Introduction:

1) Explain the three big ideas we covered / Moore's law
2) CPU Time Calculations
3) Amdahl's Law Calculations


## RISC-V:
1) C -> RISC-V program translations
2) What is the value in the registers after XYZ operations
3) What does this RISC-V program do?
4) Hand-encoding RISC-V instructions

## CALL
1) Explain different parts of CALL
2) What parts does an object module file have
3) Transforming C -> machine language
